- Someone replied to my post on /r/running from 6 years ago yesterday. I was asking about a lump on the side of my ankle, but in the photo I noticed that I also seem to have a small bump on the back of my heel. Have I had this lump for that long?- Went to the co-working space on Kenmore Road today. It was good. Damian let me use it for free today. I'd like to use it regularly - I just need to find out how much it costs per month.
