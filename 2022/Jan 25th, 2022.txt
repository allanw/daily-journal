Had some problem uploading my 2 page post yesterday. So trying this upload as a test. its AI server.Bump on lower right Achilles feels OK today - not too big.- Good appointment - informative - He said it's not a Haglund's- He suggested these exercises (N.B. focus on big toe on these exercises. Push through big toe but keep knuckle of the toe down).- Voltaire gel doesn't work for many things but can work for this.- Just a little bit of ice - not too much pressure as this could irritate it. A cube is enough.- He Said it seems to be more in the typical portion of the tendon (i.e. a bit higher up)- Not got results yet - will get them soon- $150 but get $95 Medicare rebate
