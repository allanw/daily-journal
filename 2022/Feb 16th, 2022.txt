 Got X-ray results today - says there is no definite Handgun’s bump on either side.  - Ordered Raspberry Pi Zero Kit today - does it come with camera module?  - Someone left a strange note on a napkin on our cage door today - it said "nice rods. I'll take them this week. Thanks :)” guessing they're referring to the fishing rods?
